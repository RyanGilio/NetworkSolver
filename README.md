# NetworkSolver
A program that will solve a Japanese Network Puzzle and with an image solution

The first code to be executed will be network.txt
The puzzle needs to be hardcoded in the sense it needs to know what types of pieces are in each cell, but it does't know the orientation
It will output a solution in which can be pasted into a text file
The java file will execute and read the solution text file and display the solution visually.
